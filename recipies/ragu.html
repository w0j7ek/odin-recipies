    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced large</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 celery, diced</li>
        <li>1kg ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3 cups any stock</li>
        <li>tagliatelle</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>grated pecorino romano</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, and carrots. Sauté until soft, 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef, veal, and pancetta; sauté, breaking up with the back of a spoon, until browned, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add wine; boil 1 minute, stirring often and scraping up browned bits. Add 2 1/2 cups stock and tomato paste; stir to blend. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to very low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring milk to a simmer in a small saucepan; gradually add to sauce. Cover sauce with lid slightly ajar and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until milk is absorbed, about 45 minutes, adding more stock by 1/4-cupfuls to thin if needed.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute before al dente. </li>
        <li>Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Transfer ragù to a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and toss to coat. Stir in some of the reserved pasta water by tablespoonfuls if sauce seems dry. </li>
    </ol>
